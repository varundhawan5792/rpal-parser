# rpal-parser

The parser generates a Abstract Syntax Tree for a programming language RPAL.

RPAL, the Right-reference Pedagogic Algorithmic Language, is a functional subset of PAL with an implementation on [Sourceforge](http://rpal.sourceforge.net/). It is used at the [University of Florida](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida) to teach the construction of programming languages and functional programming. Programs are strictly functional, with no sequence or assignment operations.
